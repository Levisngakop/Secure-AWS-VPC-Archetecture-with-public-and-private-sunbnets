# Secure-AWS-VPC-Archetecture-with-public-and-private-sunbnets
This project implements a secure AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture designed for high availability and fault tolerance. The architecture includes both public and private subnets spread across multiple availability zones. 
It features an Internet Gateway for public-facing resources, a NAT Gateway for secure internet access from private subnets, and is configured with robust security groups and Network ACLs. 
The setup supports scalable, redundant applications with separate layers for web servers and databases, enabling efficient management and enhanced security. Ideal for applications requiring a mix of public access and protected backend services.
